# Basic-OpenGL-Raycaster
This is a basic raycaster made in Code::Blocks. This should run on any device with OpenGL installed.
You can make your own map by just specifying the size in the mapX and mapY variable and then modifying the string array called playground as you like. mapC variable determines the compression from the map and actual view; Changing this variable to the max of mapX and mapY should work fine.
